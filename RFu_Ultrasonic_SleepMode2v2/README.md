RFu_Ultrasonic_SleepMode2v2
===========================

This code was deployed on the initial prototype sensor in Oxford in Feb 2014.

It uses the RFu's sleep mode 2 to enable deep sleep low-power mode on the sensor device.  A small change is required to the Ciseco LLAP library to increase the sleep time to a longword rather than a word.

The PDF schematic included in this repository was used for the hardware.
